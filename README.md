This is my first game made in Pygame.
Short description:
Two players are playing versus each other by passing ball. There are some elements in game which makes game more fun. When ball hits suprise box, movement speed of ball is reduced or increased or player rods are getting bigger or smaller. Game is ends when one player reached five point.
